    "group_1 = \"Computer scientist: A computer scientist is a professional who researches and analyzes how computers store and use information, develops new products or software, and solves practical computing problems. They may work as part of a research team with other IT professionals and engineers, or design efficient computer systems according to clients specifications and business functions. They also inspect and protect the security of the organization's database and manage software applications. They use algorithms, mathematics, physics, and creative thinking to study technological concepts, such as computational complexity theory, computer graphics, and programming languages. They work with different computer technologies and tools to improve and innovate existing and new ones. Some of the skills that a computer scientist needs include technical and mathematical skills, such as software development, hardware engineering, computer programming, linear algebra, discrete mathematics, calculus, and statistics. They also need technical writing skills to create technical manuals and document project data for others to interpret. Additionally, they need project management skills to lead IT teams when completing projects, communication skills to present theories and studies to the scientific community and educate other individuals in the field, and analytical skills to evaluate new computer systems or devices and conduct research experiments to test new theories.\"\n",
    "group_2 = \"Data scientist: A data scientist is a professional who collects, analyzes, and interprets large amounts of data from various sources to generate insights and solutions for business problems or scientific questions. They may work in different industries or sectors, such as healthcare, finance, education, or e-commerce. They use various methods and tools to process and manipulate data, such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, statistics, programming languages, databases, and visualization software. They also communicate their findings and recommendations to stakeholders or clients using reports, dashboards, or presentations .Some of the skills that a data scientist needs include technical skills such as Python, R, SQL, TensorFlow, Tableau, Excel etc., which are used for data analysis and manipulation. They also need mathematical and statistical skills to apply concepts such as linear algebra, probability theory, regression analysis, hypothesis testing etc., which are used for data modeling and inference. Additionally, they need business skills to understand the domain knowledge and the objectives of the projects, communication skills to explain complex data in simple terms and persuade others with data-driven arguments, and problem-solving skills to identify relevant data sources and design appropriate solutions for the challenges.\" \n",

They may work in various settings, such as malls, offices, schools, or museums. They monitor the premises using surveillance cameras or patrol on foot or by vehicle. They also enforce rules and regulations and report any suspicious or illegal activities to the authorities or management. Some of the skills that a security guard needs include physical skills such as strength, stamina, agility, and self-defense, which are used for deterring or responding to threats. They also need observation skills to spot any signs of danger or disturbance and record details of incidents. Additionally, they need communication skills to interact with the public and provide assistance or information when needed, and teamwork skills to coordinate with other security personnel or law enforcement officers when necessary.\"\n",
